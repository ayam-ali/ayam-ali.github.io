                        “I loved the cheesecake! Here's my review: I tried all three flavors: strawberry, cherry, and blueberry. I've mostly known strawberry cheesecake all my life
                        but wanted to try other falvors, and I'm glad I did! The glaze of the blueberry and cherry were so smooth and sweet, not overwhelming the other elements. I thought
                        I wouldn't like them that much, but after them, it just left me craving more! Definitely the best chseecake(s) I've had in my life so far 💯"
